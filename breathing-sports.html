            <p>Breathing is more than just a subconicious function, the process of moving air into ones lungs bringing in oxygen and removing waste carbon dioxide. Maintaining good breath control impacts many a different aspects of life especially in sports; like running and yoga to free diving and swimming.</p>

            <h3>Section on freediving <i class="fa-solid fa-anchor"></i></h3>
            <p>I would recommend going to<a href="https://gofreediving.co.uk/" target="_blank">Free diving</a>for more information.</p>
            <p>I would never suggest doing in water free diving techniques by your self, it is not safe to do so by yourself!</p>
            <p class="important">It is important to always follow the buddy system in diving, with or without a cylinder! If you want to practise breath technique in water it is imperative that you do not do so alone, it can be dangerous!</p>
            <!-- add links to articles that suggest good pools/lidos/a few photos of said nice pools -->
