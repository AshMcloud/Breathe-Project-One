        <p>This is a mindfulness website, with a touch of satire!</p>
        <p>We will be looking at the importance of good breath control for meditation and sports.<br>Whilst also touching on good ways to relax and relieve stress; how media effects this and how we can adapt to use it in a positive, benifical way! I will be especially looking at nature and ocean based content.</p>

            <h3>Media To Relax To <i class="fa-solid fa-icons"></i></h3>
            <p>It's importance of taking a moment to relax in life. Some times it's by putting on your favourite tunes, reading a book, or by watching a film or video</p>
            <p>If you're struggling to relax in the evening, maybe it's best to turn the tv or computer off a little earlier in the day, listen to music or read a book. Below I've included a quote on bluelight to show its effects on the body.</p>
            <p>"More so than any other color, blue light messes with your body’s ability to prepare for sleep because it blocks a hormone called melatonin that makes you sleepy. Bottom line: You’re less drowsy than usual at night, and it takes you longer to fall asleep."</p>

            <p>Below I have linked a couple different videos from Youtube which I have found awe-inspiring. To be one with the ocean is, in my eyes, greatly relaxing.<br>I myself created Chasing Water and being able to look back on these memories brings just as much joy as experiencing others perpectives of the ocean.</p>
