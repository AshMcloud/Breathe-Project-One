<h1>The Art of Breathing Good</h1>

Welcome to my first project website, focusing on learning HTML and CSS.<br>
You can find my site here [Breathe](https://ashmcloud.github.io/Breathe-Project-One/index.html)

<h2>What's the goal of this page</h2>

I started out with this idea to create a space for which I could collect together different content which I have found relaxing and peace bringing in the past. I hope that site users can find a moment to sit and be comfortable within themselves for a few moments whilst they consider what I have collated on my site.

<h2>What do I look to add to this site in the future?</h2>

I would like to add the addition of a comments section so people can suggest what they find peaceful a built a community space for ocean, relaxation minded indivuals.

<h2>Resources I used in this project</h2>

Main learning of code was gathered in a full stacks course by

[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

Some code was leart from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

[iframes - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp)

[html Youtube - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_youtube.asp)

I aquired the font 'Milky Coffee' for my headers sourced from [dafonts](https://www.dafont.com/milky-coffee.font)

I used a selection of different youtube videos within my website, some linked some embedded. I would like to credit following channels of the beautiful short films and sound tracks I used:

[Meditation and Healing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFfP7N8wpMA&t=510s)

The final linked video was one I filmed and edited myself.

I have used photography found on: [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

I optimized these photographs usings: [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)

And then hosted the images through [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

I had a mild snag with working out how to embed images hosted through dropbox and got some answers on [Exclaimer](https://support.exclaimer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360018586691-How-to-host-an-image-using-Dropbox)
