<h1>The Art of Breathing Good</h1>

Welcome to my first project website, focusing on learning HTML and CSS.<br>
You can find my site here [Breathe](https://ashmcloud.github.io/Breathe-Project-One/index.html)

<h2>What's the goal of this page</h2>

I started out with this idea to create a space for which I could collect together different content which I have found relaxing and peace bringing in the past. I hope that site users can find a moment to sit and be comfortable within themselves for a few moments whilst they consider what I have collated on my site. I intend for this website to be lighthearted and a little funny so I've included some jokes to balance out of the more serious nature of the breathing excerises I included which can be found on the Breathing and Sports page.

<h2>What do I look to add to this site in the future?</h2>

I would have liked to have added my own background server for the database for my form, but after looking at different online SQL they where all expensive, I look forwards to learning how to create my own too add to this in the future. for now I have used The Code Institude form dump site which is have listed in my resource section.

I would like to add the addition of a forum comments section so people can suggest what they find peaceful and built a community space for ocean, relaxation minded indivuals.

I think the addition of a gallary would be lovely, where users can submit there own art and photography and have it displayed with a comments section.

I intend to make this website funnier, punnier and more satirical in the future!

<h2>Testing</h2>




I used [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) to validate my code.

I only found a few errors whilst validating the html docs, mainly being in the iframe element:

        <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/cFfP7N8wpMA" title="A 30 minute meditation sound track" alt="A 30 miunute meditation sound track"></iframe>

Fixing it with:

        <iframe src="https://youtube.com/embed/cFfP7N8wpMA" name="A 30 minute meditation sound track"></iframe>


There was only one error whilst validating CSS, I had accidentally included a span element with and embeded paragraph, I changed it too a div.       



<h2>Resources I used in this project</h2>

Main learning of code was gathered in a full stacks course by

[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)

I would like to give a massive thanks to [James Fidler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-fidler-a445318/) for advicing me with my code!

I asked a bunch of friends and family to look over my website for feedback, special thanks too: Regan Harle, Charlie Verrall and my dad.

Some code was leart from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

[iframes HTML- W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp)

I aquired the font 'Milky Coffee' for my headers sourced from [dafonts](https://www.dafont.com/milky-coffee.font)

I had trouble adding the font 'Milky Coffee' to my website and instead have used a font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

I used a selection of different youtube videos within my website, some linked some embedded. I would like to credit following channels of the beautiful short films and sound tracks I used:

The final linked video was one I filmed and edited myself.

I added a link to the website [Rainymood](https://www.rainymood.com/) a site that hosts sound of rain fall.

I have used photography found on: [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

I used a comic strip by [K C Green](https://gunshowcomic.com/648) I emailed him to ask permission to use it.

I optimized these photographs using [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)

And then hosted the images through [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)

I had a mild snag with working out how to embed images hosted through dropbox and got some answers on [Exclaimer](https://support.exclaimer.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360018586691-How-to-host-an-image-using-Dropbox)

I have added icons to my headers to give them a little more style [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

Pun inspiration came from here [Readers Digest](https://www.rd.com/article/fish-puns/)

I have included a couple of medical articles from that look at the effects of blue light on the brain and also one of breathing techniques. [WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/)

I have also linked to the program [F.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) which does wonders for mitigating the effects of bluelight on scrcens.
